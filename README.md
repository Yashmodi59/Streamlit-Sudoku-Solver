# Streamlit-Sudoku-Solver
Made to check the accuracy of digit recognition model in practical use!

### Run
```
streamlit run main.py
```

### The Web App

We build the app using Streamlit. The app needs to allow us to upload an image,
solve the Sudoku, and display the results.

### Conclusion :

In this small project, we build a Sudoku solving application in Streamlit. We
train a custom OCR model along the way and use backtracking to solve the actual
Sudoku grid.
